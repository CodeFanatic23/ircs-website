The horrors of the evening can be well explained only by those who had experienced the nightmare of a devastating earthquake measuring 6.9 magnitudes on the Richter scale. But memories of the faces of near and dear ones lost, the picture of the ravaged surroundings, broken homes, derailed lives and that horrifying sound shall never fade from the minds of    the survivors who have lived to tell the tale.<br>

It is hard to apply a quick salve on our wounded bruise and bounce back to life immediately.  It&rsquo;s even more difficult to scratch away the dried remains of a frozen tragedy and restart life afresh.  The vestiges of the scar continue to haunt. To spread the blanket of forgetfulness over a pain that&rsquo;s raw and unhealed becomes impossible for a bereaved family member. Cruel, it may sound but death brings a closure. But the fear of no knowledge about a missing loved one does not even give the opportunity to mourn the loss of a near one. <strong> </strong><a href="abandoned-across-border-130212.htm">More&raquo;</a></td>

  &ldquo;Traditional Indian systems of medicine are holistic as they help us in management of mind and body&rdquo;, said Mrs. S. Jalaja, Secretary, Deptt. of Ayush, Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, GoI. In her inaugural speech she mentioned that older systems of medication, like Chinese, Arabic and Indian, had gone into hibernation after the Greeks developed an allopathic system. Though the allopathic system has its own merits and provides immediate relief the Ayurvedic and Yogic systems develop all round immunity, improve well being of human beings.<a href="pressRel4may2010.htm">More&raquo;</a></div></td>

                                            Climate Change is a matter of global concern and it is emerging as a real threat to all living beings. It has been predicted that any change in temperature, humidity regime, rainfall pattern and climatic condition will have direct and indirect impacts on the health of all living beings. Directly, there will be an increase in the number of deaths due to greater frequency and severity of heat waves and other extreme weather events. Indirectly, changes in weather pattern, can lead to ecological disturbances, changes in food production levels, increase in the distribution of malaria, dengue and other vector-borne diseases. <a href="pressRel7Apr.htm">More&raquo;</a></div></td>

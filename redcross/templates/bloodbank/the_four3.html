 <p><strong> <center> Donate Blood-Save Lives </center> </strong> </p>
 <br>
 <p>Blood donation is a process by which a blood donor voluntarily has blood drawn for storage in a blood bank or for subsequent use in a blood transfusion according to his/her own free will and receive no payment for it, either in cash, or in kind.</p>
 <p>Blood donations may be scheduled at local centres, or at times a "blood drive" will occur. These are events where a blood bank or other blood collecting organization will set up in a convenient location—such as a shopping centre, large employer, university, or a local church—for people to stop in without appointment during their daily routine to donate blood.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:red" ><strong> Before arriving at the donation site: </strong></p>
<p>A day prior to donating blood, it is important that donors prepare themselves for a process.</p>
<p>Donors should check their local blood bank's guidelines, as requirements and recommendations vary. Many blood banks recommend that potential donors drink extra water and fluids before donating.</p>
<p>Eating well is also important, and can reduce the risk of reactions to donation. Eating foods high in iron (which has many dietary sources) is also a good idea; low hemoglobin levels may make a donor temporarily ineligible. This is especially true for women because of the loss of iron during a period.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:red" ><strong> Pre donation process: </strong></p>
<p>When a donor arrives at a donation site, they typically fill out a consent form as well as answer an extensive questionnaire to help determine their eligibility. Questions include the donors' age, weight, most recent donation, current health, and various risk factors such as tattooing, drug use (recreational or performance enhancing), residency abroad, recent international travel, and sexual history. Answers are associated with the donor's blood, but not name, to provide anonymity.</p>

<p style="color:red" ><strong> Who can donate blood?</strong></p>
<p> Eligibility criteria for blood donation </p>
            <ol style ="list-style-type:circle">
                    <li>Donor should be between 18-60 years of age with a weight of 50 kg or above with pulse rate, body temperature and blood pressure should be normal. Both men and women can donate.</li>
                    <br><li> There are only few conditions in which donors are permanently excluded. The donor with history of epilepsy, psychotic disorders, abnormal bleeding tendencies, severe asthma, cardiovascular disorders, malignancy are permanently unfit for blood donation.</li>
                    <br><li>Donors suffering from disease like Hepatitis after full recovery and with 3-year gap. In addition, people who have undergone surgery, blood transfusion may safely donate blood after 6-12 mths for woman donors who are pregnant or lactating, blood is not taken as their iron reserves are already on the lower side.
                            <ol style ="list-style-type:square">
                                <br><li>A normal adult has five to six liters of blood in his/her body of which only 300ml – 400ml blood is drawn during blood donation depending upon the weight.</li>
                                <li>Your body replaces this blood within 24 to 48 hours!</li>
                                <li>No special diet, rest or medicine is required after blood donation.</li>
                            </ol>

                    </li>
            </ol>
<br>

<p style="color:red" ><strong> Medical Examination for Blood Donation:</strong></p>
<p>Every donor is given a medical checkup prior to donation to see if he/she is medically fit and doesn't suffer from- </p>
    <ol style ="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Anemia, high blood pressure etc.</li>
        <li>The donor should not have taken any medicine in the last 48 hours.</li>
        <li>The donor should not have contracted jaundice in the previous three years.</li>
        <li>The donor cannot contract AIDS or any other disease by donating blood.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
        <p>Often the blood hemoglobin concentration will be checked next, typically performed by a phlebotomist or staff nurse. While various tests exist, the most common ones are:
    <ol style ="list-style-type:circle">
        <li> colorimetric hemoglobin test using a hemoglobin photometer: a machine-read result from a chemical reaction on a testing strip.</li>
        <li> copper sulfate screening test (aka "float test"): measures the specific gravity of the donor's blood by placing a drop into a copper sulfate solution. The solution is calibrated so that a hemoglobin concentration of in ≥12.5 g/dl (the cut-off in the Indian for donations) sinks.</li>
    </ol>
<br>
<p>All blood is later tested after donation in the blood banks for following diseases</p>
    <ol style ="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>HIV I II</li>
        <li>HbsAg (Hepatitis B)</li>
        <li>Hepatitis C</li>
        <li> Malaria</li>  
        <li>VDRL</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

<p style="color:red" ><strong> BLOOD DONATION- The actual process</strong></p>
<p>The donor lies supine on a cushioned bench and extends an arm. The inner elbow is disinfected, and a cannula is inserted into a vein. The donor often has a tourniquet wrapped around his or her arm, or may be prompted to squeeze a ball repeatedly, to help speed the process. Blood flows from the vein, through the needle and a tube, and into a special collection bag, which is placed on a small scale to measure the amount of blood withdrawn. Typically, around 300 to 400  millilitres, is drawn during the blood donation process depending upon the weight and height of the donor.</p>
<br>

<p><u><center>Disinfect, insert the cannula, pull out the cannula, dress the wound.</center></u></p>
<br>
<img src="/static/bloodbank/images/blooddonation2.jpg" alt="" style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20% ;" class="img-responsive">
<p><u><center>A mechanical tray tilts the bag to prevent congealing, and displays current volume and flow per minute.</center></u></p>
<br>

<p style="color:red" ><strong> Storage </strong></p>
<p>Blood is collected and then stored in the proper storage refrigerator for the transportation.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:red" ><strong> Recovery</strong></p>
<p>Once the donation is complete, the donor is given a bandage or gauze to stop further blood flow and is normally allowed to leave. Beverages and snacks may be provided to restore blood volume and blood sugar, and to settle the stomach. Often donors are encouraged to sit down for a few minutes to return to normality, as lightheadedness and faintness may occur.</p>
<br>
<p>The entire process, from screening to recovery, takes about 15-20 minutes. Donors are discouraged from heavy exercise or lifting until the next day. Plasma volumes will return to normal in around 24-48 hours, while red blood cells are replaced by bone marrow into the circulatory system within about 3-5 weeks, and lost iron replaced over 6-8 weeks. This recovery process can be speeded by eating foods high in complex carbohydrates, iron, and other trace minerals. Due to the time frame required for iron replacement, donors are eligible to donate whole blood after twelve weeks from the previous donation.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:red" ><strong> Complications </strong></p>
<p>Finger prick and needle insertion typically cause only minor discomfort. Phlebotomists may however experience difficulties in obtaining enough blood from some donors.</p>
<p>During or shortly after the donation, hypovolemia may occasionally lead to a drop in blood pressure with some donors experiencing light-headedness or fainting(Vasovgal phenonomena). In some cases, this may necessitate canceling the donation, restoring blood volume with an intravenous infusion, or placing the donor in a Trendelenburg position (on a stretcher tilted "legs up").</p>
<p>Beverages may be given to further replenish blood volume, and the donor may have to remain in a horizontal position for a while under monitoring. Most blood banks encourage donors to rest for several minutes after donation (often while eating and drinking) to let them adjust to the loss of blood and reduce the risk of these problems.</p>
<p>In less than 1% of cases, improperly inserting the needle is followed by bruising of the arm in the weeks afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Negative medical reactions to blood donation are rare and blood bank staffs are trained to handle them.</p></strong>
<br>
<p style="color:red" ><strong> What is done with the blood collected? </strong></p>
<p>The blood collected in sterile, pyrogen free containers with anticoagulants like CPDA or CPDA with SAGM. This prevents clotting and provides nutrition for the cells. This blood is stored at 2-6ºC or 22ºC depending on the component prepared.</p>
<p>Donated blood undergoes various tests like blood grouping antibody detection, testing of infections like hepatitis, AIDS, Malaria, syphilis and before it reaches the recipient it undergoes compatibility testing with the recipient blood.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:red" ><strong> Modern Blood Transfusion Practice: </strong></p>
<p>Modern blood transfusion deals with the optimal use of one unit of blood. One unit of whole blood is separated into components making it available to different patients according to their requirement. Thus, one unit of blood is converted into packed cell volume, fresh frozen plasma, platelet concentrate, cryoprecipitate and granulocytes concentrate.</p>
<p>Another important practice is apheresis. This is separation of only desired component from the donor and returns the remaining constituent back to donor. This technique is also used for remaining pathological substance in patients.</p>
<p><strong> Withdrawal of blood for transfusion is regarded as a safe procedure now and blood donor has emerged as the single most vital link.</strong></p>
